Allan, CNNCNN — I can't think of a more fitting start to this story than to point out it's the same one I wrote last year, with some dates changed to reflect two years into the pandemic instead of one.\nDon't be bothered. You probably never read it last year, and if you did, you've long forgotten it. But read on. It's just as relevant then as it is now. Welcome to life on auto-repeat, where we take you back to this question the film \"Groundhog Day\" poses:\n\"What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?\"\nThat's what a depressed Phil Connors (played by actor Bill Murray) asks two men at a bar as he contemplates the bleak fate of repeating Groundhog Day over and over.",
